# bargabso-Babysitting_Service_DB_Management
This project involves designing and implementing a database management system for babysitting services. The database was built using MySQL and includes at least six entities, following an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). The system handles various operations like data storage, user queries, and business logic with 12 SQL queries and 4 DML/DDL commands. Sample data was inserted to demonstrate the functionality of the system. The project was developed to meet specific business requirements for managing babysitting services efficiently.
